# Highlow-Game
Inspired from the #1 indie game on Discord, Dank Memer!
This is a Java-based piece of code which effectuates the command `/highlow` from Dank Memer. I am attempting to write all of the simpler commands in Java, to enhance my knowledge of the language!
This is in text-based form, and will facilitate applet form at a later time.

I DO NOT OWN DANK MEMER, AND THIS PROJECTS AND THOSE WHICH FOLLOW ARE PURELY FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES.
