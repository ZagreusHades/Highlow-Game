# Highlow-Game
Inspired from the #1 indie game on Discord, Dank Memer!
This is a Java-based piece of code which effectuates the command `/highlow` from Dank Memer. I am attempting to write all of the simpler commands in Java, to enhance my knowledge of the language!
This is in text-based form, and will facilitate applet form at a later time.


To play the game - 
A hint number will be provided. What you have to do is guess if the real number is lower or higher than the hint number, or if it is the same as the hint number. 







I DO NOT OWN DANK MEMER, AND THIS PROJECTS AND THOSE WHICH FOLLOW ARE PURELY FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES.
